# Rhythm and scale

This is a sample extension that generates a typographic scale for font-sizes based on Tim Brown's popular article on the subject of [typography and modular scale](https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/).

The extension also generates line-heights associated with each of the font-sizes that follow a [vertical rhythm](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/8-point-grid-vertical-rhythm-90d05ad95032). This creates a consistent vertical spacing between elements on page with text that's aligned on a repeating baseline grid.

The output is a collection of CSS custom properties for all headings (`h1`â€“`h6`), and the default and `small` body copy.
